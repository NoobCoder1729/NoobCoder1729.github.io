# Riddhiman Bhattacharya

## Bio
Hi, I am Riddhiman. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Daniels School of Business, Purdue University working in Statistics and Reinforcement Learning. Previously, I obtained my PhD from the University of Minnesota, under the guidance of Professor Tiefeng Jiang. I have also worked with Professor Galin Jones, Professor Wei Sun, Professor Thanh Nguyen and Professor Mohit Tawarmalani. I am interested in Fast Sampling, Stochastic Optimization, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Reinforcement Learning, MDPs, Bayesian Modeling.
